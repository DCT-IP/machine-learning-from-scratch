# machine-learning-from-scratch
Classical machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch using NumPy, with emphasis on mathematical foundations, optimisation, and failure analysis

This repository contains implementations of classical machine learning algorithms written from scratch using NumPy.
The goal of this repo is to learn ML to understand mathematics and optimization.
