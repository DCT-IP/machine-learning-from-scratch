# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project implements **Linear Regression from scratch** to predict housing prices using a real-world dataset.  
The focus is not only on building a predictive model, but also on understanding the **convergence behavior of Gradient Descent**, feature scaling, and evaluation without relying on machine learning libraries like `scikit-learn`.
